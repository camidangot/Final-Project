# Final-Project
For our final project, we decided to create a game testing people's knowledge on languages called Language Master950. In this game, players are able to select the languages they know. Each language corresponds to a different background color. Depending on the languages they select, images will appear on the screen with the corresponding color, and players must type the word in the corresponding language as accurately and quickly as they can.   Our game includes five languages, Enlgish, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Italian and images such as a dog, stairs, tree, car, and chair. 

Due to the randomization we used, since there only five trials per game, not every language may show up (if a language doesn't appear in the game, the result for that language will apper as nan)

We hope our game will allow players to compare their knowledge between languages (such as the speed in which they can come up with answers for Spanish vs. English), as well as explore their ability to adapt to sudden and quick transitions between languages! 

The final code which we are submitting is under the file FINAL.py in the github â€” it combines all of the seperate parts of our code which we used to build the game. In addition, in order to create our project we used the psychopy toolboxfrom from which we imported visual, monitors, Window, core, event. We also imported csv, numpy, panda, Image from PIL, and random.
